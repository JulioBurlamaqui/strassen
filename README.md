# strassen
Hybrid Strassen matrix multiplication algorithm

Work for my Data Structure class in College.

Task command goes as follows:

Should the argument -n followed by a number is passed when the program is called, the program must generate randomly two square matrices of order that were passed before
-n argument. Then, it must multiplicate, first using the traditional method, subsequently using Strassen's. Finally, it must print each runtime.

Should there is no argument when the program is called, the program must read the order of the matrices and their values. After that, it must multiplicate likewise 
the first case and print both results.
